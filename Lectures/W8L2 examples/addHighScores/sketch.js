/**
The purpose of this example is to test the process of inserting a new
score into the high scores array in sorted order.

Press 'h' to generate a new highest score. Press 'm' to generate a score
somewhere between the lowest and highest score. Press 'l' to generate a
new lowest score. Generated scores will have the player name GEN.
